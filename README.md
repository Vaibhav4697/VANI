Gesture Vocalizer with Haptic Hand

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1.
VANI - A digital vocalizer is a mission for community resolution. We are trying to implement a system which makes a communication gap between peoples with sensory impairment (deaf, blind and mute) and hearing people as less as possible. Deaf people make use of sign language or gestures to make understand what he/she trying to convey; but it is impossible to understand by people like us, who are unaware of the sign language.

2.
Gesture language is the main method for the deaf-mute, but not many people understand gesture language. How to help them and let more people understand their meaning? So we made this gesture language voice device model, expecting to improve the efficiency of communication between the deaf-mute and ordinary people to some extent. With the help of the voice device, the deaf-mute can convert the gesture language expression to language understandable to our normal people, to reach the purpose of communicating with the normal people.
Basically, an Artificial Neural Network is the concept of our prototype. Some sensors are placed on the hand of deaf people which converts the parameter like finger bend hand position angle into electrical signal and provide it to Atmega 328 controller and controller take action according to the sign.
Advantages of innovation
1. It is a social cause project
2. Deaf people can easily communicate with normal people
3. Easy to implement
4. Easy to make change of sensor windows according to wearing hand
5. Portable design works on 9V small Radio battery
6. Audio as well as Visual output
